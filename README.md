### Describe the difference between asynchronous programming with synchronous programming.
1. Asynchronous is multi-thread, allowing operations or programs to run in parallel. Synchronous is single-thread, allowing only one operation to run at a time.
2. Asynchronous is non-blocking, which means it can send multiple requests to a server simultaneously. Synchronous is blocking, can only send a request one at a time and will wait for a response to that request.
3. Asynchronous allows operations to be run independently, without waiting for the completion of previous operations, excluding those that have dependencies on other operations. Synchronous programming only lets operations start after the previous ones have been completed.
4. Asynchronous programs can produce larger throughput than synchronous ones since multiple operations can run at the same time

### When Implementing Javascript and AJAX, there is an application in the paradigms of Event-Driven Programming. Describe the reasoning for those paradigms and state some examples of its application.

### Describe the implementation of asynchronous programming in AJAX.
